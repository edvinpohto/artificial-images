# artificial-images
A project utilising the OpenAI API to create AI images.

The scripts require an API added to your .env file to work, and can be found at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

OpenAI charges for each image generated, but offers a $18 credit to get yourself started.

This project is essentially a programmatical replica of Dall-E and was created out of curiosity towards the API.

To initialise the project, clone the repository and install the required packages with <code>node install</code>.
